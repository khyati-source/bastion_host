Yes, âœ… you can attach an SSM role to a private EC2 instance without a NAT Gateway â€” but for it to work, you must give that instance private network access to AWS SSM endpoints.

âœ… Solution: Use VPC Endpoints for SSM (PrivateLink)
ðŸ“¦ Required Interface Endpoints:
You must create these VPC Interface Endpoints in the same VPC/subnet as the private instance:

| AWS Service                | Endpoint Name                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Systems Manager            | `com.amazonaws.<region>.ssm`         |
| EC2 Messages               | `com.amazonaws.<region>.ec2messages` |
| SSM Messages               | `com.amazonaws.<region>.ssmmessages` |
| (Optional) CloudWatch Logs | `com.amazonaws.<region>.logs`        |
Replace <region> with your AWS region, e.g., ap-south-1

ðŸ›  Steps to Make SSM Work Without NAT:
Attach IAM Role to instance
With the following policy:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:*",
        "ec2messages:*",
        "ssmmessages:*",
        "logs:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

âœ… Or use AWS-managed policy: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore

Go to VPC â†’ Endpoints â†’ Create Endpoint
Choose Interface endpoint
Select services:
com.amazonaws.<region>.ssm
com.amazonaws.<region>.ec2messages
com.amazonaws.<region>.ssmmessages
  
Choose the VPC and private subnet
Enable Private DNS
Attach to appropriate security group (allow HTTPS: port 443)
Ensure instance has DNS resolution and hostnames enabled
In VPC â†’ DNS settings: DNS hostnames = enabled, DNS resolution = enabled
Make sure EC2 has outbound access to port 443 (HTTPS)
Wait ~2â€“3 minutes, then go to SSM â†’ Fleet Manager or use:
aws ssm start-session --target <instance-id>

  âœ… Result:
Your private instance will be fully managed via SSM without needing a NAT Gateway or public IP.
